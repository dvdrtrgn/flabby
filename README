idea hurdles
1   field in which you click a location and the box eases to that point
    css that does transition time of box
    js that gets mouse click (and puts offset onto box)
2   movement tracker that has two boxes one to min-movement and one to max-...
    movement within the min. has no effect
    outside the min but within max has to factored
3   parallel fields that have a zoom factor
    each field can siblings at strata
    view of one affects angle of all
4   field rotation according to tracker in #2
    axis y and x (maybe z)
5   verify auto margin can be used for a controlled float layout
    has min and max, keeps centered
6   send two object properties to a function to calc collision
    send a point in space to an object and ask if it is there
7   background image attach the three different ways
    fixed, local, scroll
8   devise accessors methods
    standard and fallbacks
